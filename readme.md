# PCComponentes buy bot

A small buying bot made in node for pccomponentes.com so you can get the 3080 you're dying for. (**This could be outdated because of changes on the website. Pull requests are welcome**)

## How-to

A few things are needed for the bot to work. Node installed and the chromedriver for the release of your chrome installation (you can install it from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started))

Install the node modules with the command `npm script` on the project folder. Then you need to edit the parameters in the index.ts file. Note that if you don't have a credit/debit card in your pccomponentes account you can add a card here so the bot will add it in the buying process, but it's not required.

```javascript
let card: ICard = {
  name: 'AMADOR RIVAS',
  num: 54025187234213,
  expiryDate: 0925,
  cvc: 134
}

const app = new Bot({
  email: 'amador@mariscosrecio.com',
  password: 'yoquese',
  card: card,
  link: 'https://www.pccomponentes.com/msi-rtx-3060-ti-ventus-2x-oc-8gb-gddr6',
  maxPrice: 440,
  refreshRate: 5000
})

app.run()
```

Finally run `npm start` and let it work
